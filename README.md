Libraries: 
## 1) DataCamp Notebook for eCommerce data analysis; a python based solution for three questions raised by DataCamp. (created 2024.07.27.)
folder: /DataCamp/eCommerce_Analysis
done: 2024
DataCamp is a website offering tutorials, education in DataScience, Machine learning, ... and offers notebook for data manipulation and immediate (simple) plots. Large variety of python modules are available (for import).

Data can be found in the folder as * *online_retail.zip* * and * *online_retail.csv* *

Solution for platform independent view (especially for those who have no access to any Notebook application):
**eCommerce_python_Analysis_Notebook_202407.html** - readable with any webbrowser
**eCommerce_python_Analysis_Notebook_202407.pdf** - open with any pdf reader

For those who would like to check or modify interactively a notebook file: notebook.ipynb
It can be loaded and run by Notebook applications, like DataCamp website (where a profile can be easily set up for free) or Jupyter Notebook (using localhost) or else.
Jupyter Notebook 7.0.8 was tested for compatibility.

All above listed files are zipped in: datacamp_workspace.zip 

## 2) JDS Academy - Accidents database analysis
folder: /JDS_academy
done: 2020

Seasonality of accidents, costs of accidents, car brands related highlights and further topics are elaborated with **Python Pandas** as in-built function of Jupyter Notebook.
The notebook can be found as
- accidents.ipynb
- accidents.html (for platform independent reading)
- accidents.pdf (converted html file)
Additional analysis of the dataset are in the presentation files:
**Accidents_table_presentation_final_eng.pptx**
and its pdf version
**Accidents_table_presentation_final_eng.pdf**

## 3) Interactive 3D scatterplot (GUI)
folder: /DataRepresentations/3Dscatter
done: 2024
